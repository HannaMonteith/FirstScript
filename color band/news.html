                <p>
                    As you promised me that I was more than all the miles combined
                    You must have had yourself a change of heart like halfway through the drive
                    Because your voice trailed off exactly as you passed my exit sign
                    Kept on driving straight and left our future to the right
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now I am stuck between my anger and the blame that I can't face
                    And memories are something even smoking weed does not replace
                    And I am terrified of weather 'cause I see you when it rains
                    And doc told me to travel but there's COVID on the planes
                <p>
                    And I, love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks
                    And I, saw your mom, she forgot that I existed
                    And it's, half my fault but I just like to play the victim
                    I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas
                    And I'll, dream each night of some version of you
                    That I, might not have but I did not lose
                    Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes
                    And I'm split in half but that'll have to do
                </p>

                    Oh, there was heaven in your eyes, I was not baptized
                    Everything's alright when She calls me back She calls me back
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lost for a long time Two parallel lines
